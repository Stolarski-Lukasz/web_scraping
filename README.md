# Example web scraping scripts

This repository contains example web scraping scripts used in my academic projects as well as for private purposes. The scripts were written using object-oriented programming (OOP) and adhere to SOLID principles. Currently, the repository provides the following examples:

1. Hansard_MPs - it is a part of the web scraping task performed on [Commons and Lords Hansard Corpus](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/), which is a corpus of debates in the British Parliament in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This particular script focuses on gathering detailed information on individual MPs. The obtained data were later used in the project titled "Descriptive Statistics of Speeches Given by the First British Female MPs as Evidence of Their Parliamentary Activity." The project focuses on quantifying the language used by the first women in the British Parliament in comparison to their male counterparts in the same historical period. See also an example of my statistical analysis performed on the basis of the MPs data gathered by this script at [github.com/Stolarski-Lukasz/R_scripts](https://github.com/Stolarski-Lukasz/R_scripts).
